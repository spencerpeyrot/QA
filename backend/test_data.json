    "question": "What are the key market trends affecting tech stocks in Q1 2025?",
    "report_text": "Based on our analysis, three major trends are impacting tech stocks in Q1 2024:\n\n1. AI Impact: Companies with strong AI capabilities, particularly in generative AI, are seeing increased valuations. NVIDIA has maintained its momentum from 2023, and Microsoft's investment in OpenAI continues to drive growth.\n\n2. Interest Rate Sensitivity: The tech sector remains sensitive to interest rate expectations. The market is pricing in potential rate cuts in 2024, which has led to improved sentiment for growth stocks.\n\n3. Semiconductor Supply Chain: Global chip demand remains strong, with particular growth in high-performance computing and automotive sectors. TSMC and Samsung have announced expanded manufacturing investments.\n\nThese factors suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook for tech stocks, though valuations in some segments, particularly AI-focused companies, may be stretched."
